            I am an undergraduate Computer Science and Applied Computational and Mathematical Sciences student at the University of Washington with 
            a passion for intricate or complex systems. While I feel comfortable building full-stack applications, I'm particularly excited about building
            large-scale cloud data systems or training and deploying machine learning models for virtually any use case. I also have a strong background in 
            biology and bioinformatics.

            When I'm not coding up something, you'll likely find me reading, practicing guitar, or writing. Literature and music has always held a
            deep importance in my heart and you can find my reading list here at <a href="src/reading.html">src/reading</a>. I also love to write whether it be
            short stories or long form reflective content. I'm definitely not great at it and honestly my intended audience is for no one but myself, however if 
            you're interested you can some of my writing at <a href="src/writing.html">src/writing</a>. To unwind, I enjoy playing tennis or driving!

            My journey in tech and medicine has taken me from working on medical software (UW Medicine) to large scale applications that handle thousands of users daily (Amazon).
            Whether it's an internship challenge or a personal project, I'm all about learning and pushing my limits. Who knows?
