## December
The boy stood tapping his foot to the beat of the song streaming through his headphones, a yellow strip of indented bumps the only thing between him and the short drop-off to the rails in front of him. He wore a gray backpack and had a black guitar case slung across his right shoulder and his shoulders strained to hold them both. In his hands, he fiddled with his phone, methodically replaying a segment of the song blasting from his headphones over and over again on Spotify.

The boy raised his head to glance up at the screen mounted to the ceiling of the station. The mechanical white font displayed that the northbound train was due in 3 minutes. He sighed, looking down at his phone, wondering if he should just let the song finish while he waited. He glanced around again, silently counting the sparsely distributed commuters around him, before his eyes locked onto a girl standing right in front of him, staring up from the tracks.

He startled slightly. Quickly, he glanced around the platform once more, thoughts racing to see if anyone else noticed her. No one else seemed to even remotely care that some girl was on the tracks. All around him were the same disinterested commuters, staring blankly at the curved wall in front of them or engaging in small conversations. He turned his attention back to the girl, staring intently down at her.

She smiled, pointing to her ears. Instinctively, he removed his headphones, letting them hang around his neck. She appeared somewhat fuzzy...

"Well, hello," she greeted.

"Hi," he responded slowly. The more he stared, the more he began to recognize her. They had known each other well, years ago.

"Long time no see," she grinned at him. He didn't grin back.

"Why are you here?"

"That's no way to greet a friend, is it?"

"I haven't seen you since 2021, and now you show up here. Why?"

The girl made a pouting face, then returned to grinning. Something about the exchange seemed amusing to her.

"Clearly, you've been thinking about me," she winked at him.

"Have I now?"

"Yup. I think I've been on your mind recently."

The boy crouched down, his backpack and guitar case pulling him backward as he leaned forward to peer at the girl. Their eyes were almost level now, though he remained on higher ground.

"I've been busy. I think I would know if you've been on my mind."

He was peering deeply into her eyes now, her pupils like pools of obsidian contrasting sharply with her ashy white skin. It was a habit of his to stare too deeply into someone's eyes. People often said it made them uncomfortable, but the girl held firm, staring back as if it were a challenge.

"I wouldn't be here if you weren't thinking of me."

"So, what do you want? I thought we parted ways amicably last time."

The girl broke off the staring contest, turning her entire body toward the tunnel from which the train would arrive. She began balancing on one of the metal rails, gracefully taking a few steps to the right before jumping onto the farther rail and repeating the process to the left. It made the boy feel slightly dizzy.

"We did part as friends, but I'm here to see if we could play together again." She didn't stop her pacing.

The boy was silent. He looked back at the display; only a couple of minutes had passed. Glancing around again, it seemed no one cared about this apparition pacing around the tracks. He turned back to her.

"What do you have in mind, then?"

She stopped pacing, feet balanced on the rail farthest from him.

"Let's play hopscotch."

He chuckled dryly. "Hopscotch. Here. When the train arrives in—" he looked at the display again, "—a minute."

She made her pouting face again. "So? Not like you're going to find anyone else who wants to play with you."

"Ouch."

"You know it's true. You almost pride yourself on it."

"That's not true. I have friends."

She smirked. "And you want to tell me you've hung out with them sometime in the last month?"

"I would like to plead the fifth."

"Exactly. You're a loner through and through, whether you like it or not."

The boy hesitated.

"I'm…" The 'm' trailed off for a second. "I'm not a loner."

"You whine about being alone, yet you prefer solitude. You complain about having no friends but make no effort to keep them. You tell me what you are."

"That… was uncalled for."

An awkward silence settled between them. The boy wasn't sure how to respond. She wasn't wrong per se, but he didn't entirely agree with her either. Right?

The girl broke the silence first.

"Forget it. What if I just gave you a hug instead?" she grinned, stretching her arms wide.

The boy was conflicted. He hadn't talked to many people lately, so a hug honestly didn't sound bad. How bad could it be to climb down onto the tracks for just a second? But before he could decide, the rushing air and screeching of the incoming train snapped him back to his senses. The girl made a face, leaping smoothly back onto the platform and landing in a crouch beside him. They stood simultaneously, facing each other as the train slowed beside them.

"I'll see you around," she said, once again wearing her cheeky smile.

"Yeah, see you around," the boy mumbled, but she had already disappeared into the throng of people exiting the train car before he finished.

The boy sighed, put his headphones back on, and walked onto the train. As he pressed play, he stared wistfully through the glass window of the doorway and could swear he saw the girl sitting on one of the platform's benches, waving as his carriage pulled away. He'd see her again, he was sure of it.

## February
"I thought you were scared of heights"

The boy was slumped against the cold metal door on the rooftop of his apartment building, twenty-six stories above the sprawling city below. Twilight painted the sky with streaks of orange and violet, shadows stretching across the concrete surface, giving shape to vague figures that resembled twisted inkblots. He stared blankly at these shapes, numbness settling heavily into his chest. The rooftop of the Standard's north tower was his final refuge, a place to escape the suffocating confines that the monotony of daily life brought.

In his peripheral, he watched her figure balancing effortlessly on the edge of the parapet. She walked along the narrow ledge with arms outstretched, silhouetted sharply against the radiant sunset. Her movements were elegant and carefree, waltzing along to some unheard melody. He felt a deep sense of jealousy—a quiet longing to feel even a fraction of her freedom.

"I see you aren't," he finally answered, his voice dull, detached.

"I’ve always wanted to be a bird," she said wistfully, stepping lightly from side to side, daring the drop beneath her. "To just leap off the edge and glide away, leaving everything and everyone else behind."

"Like a bird huh."

"Yep. I want to leap right off of here and glide across the sky."

"Get down from there", he murmured weakly. "You're going to slip and fall."

The girl made her signature playful pouting face. Despite his unease, he couldn't tear his eyes away from her. She had an ethereal glow about face, with her long black hair flowing gently in the breeze, porcelain skin gleaming in the fading light, eyes so dark they seemed to contain endless night. But something about her beauty felt melancholic as if she was beyond his grasp, his understanding.

"Why come here if you're just going to worry?" she teased lightly.

"I like the solitude. Or well I LIKED it before you came up here."

"So you are a loner"

It was the boy's turn to make a face now. Remembering their previous conversation at the train station, he couldn't deny that she had got him.

"You’re here," he replied softly, a fragile attempt at deflection.

To his surprise, the girl started laughing, clutching her stomach and stepping down from the parapet as she laughed. Her laughter rang out clearly, cutting through the silence and wind. Stepping gracefully down from the ledge, she landed lightly and noiselessly onto the rooftop. Her smile was bright, her dark eyes gentle, yet piercing through the darkening sky.

"Yes," she agreed simply. "Yes, I am."

She bent down, slipping off her sneakers carefully, setting them neatly aside on the ledge, the tips pointing out towards the abyss. Barefoot now, she hopped effortlessly back onto the parapet, beckoning him gently toward her. "Come on," she coaxed softly, her voice carrying an intimacy he’d long forgotten. "It feels different up here. You should try it."

The boy sighed again but he got up and walked towards her. The parapet was much smaller than he had thought, barely even reaching half a foot tall. The wind bit at his body and he cautiously stood just before the roof edge, just inches away from the empty air that stretched twenty-size stories downwards. The vertigo was terrifying and exhilarating at the same time, the adrenaline of knowing how close they were to complete annihilation, that even one step would mark the end of their very existence.

He looked up at the girl. She looked down at him.

"I can see why you like this," he murmured.

"You should join me then," she offered.

"It's a little scary."

"Thats ok. I'm up here aren't I."

The sun had fully set now, darkness wrapping around them, softening their silhouettes. He could barely make out her features, yet he knew instinctively that she was smiling.

"You're tired aren't you?" her voice was gentle, quiet, a reflection of the boy's inner thoughts.

He knew what she meant. He nodded.

"Wouldn't it be nice," she whispered, barely audible above the wind, "to just let go of all this pressure? All the loneliness?"

He knew what she meant. He nodded. 

"You don't have to be alone."

Her hand stretched toward him in the dimness, the promise of release. His mind blurred as emotions cascaded chaotically through him, a storm of longing, exhaustion, and despair. He wanted it himself, to just take her hand and leap off the edge.

But as his fingers reached toward her, his phone buzzed sharply in his pocket, jolting him violently from his reverie. The sudden intrusion from the mundane world he was so desperately trying to escape, snapped him awake. He drew his hand back sharply, breathing hard, heart racing.

The boy took one last long look at the glittering city below, at the abyss he had nearly chosen, then slowly turned away from the edge. He glanced back toward the metal door that led back inside—back to life, back to reality, imperfect yet real. He turned fully away from the girl, forcing himself to move his legs.

"I’m sorry," he said, voice thick with emotion. "I'll talk to you later."

He knew she would wait for him. He knew he would see her again, sooner or later. But for tonight, at least, he had decided to stay.

## April
The boy was exhausted.

It was the type of exhaustion that lingered not just in the heaviness hidden behind his eyes, but deep inside his body, saturating every muscle, nerve, and bone. He could hardly recall the last time he'd truly rested. Sleep itself had become meaningless, a nightmare fueled state punctuated by anxiety-ridden awakenings and a perpetual sense of dread for the next day ahead.

He glanced at the table in front of him - two empty cans of Celsius stood beside his laptop, a mocking monument to the fruitless hours he'd poured into the tasks demanded by his manager. The black screen of his laptop reflected his tired face and bloodshot eyes, distorted by the  smudges that lay painted upon it.

Checking his phone, he felt a twist in his gut: it wasn't even 10 AM yet. Had he arrived on campus at 8? Or was it 9? Did he lock his car? His memory recently was blurring together, days blending into nights, nights into dawns. His existence had become nothing but rote programming, drifting between obligation and quiet desperation.

He stood up abruptly, nausea surging in his stomach as dizziness overcame him briefly. He steadied himself on the edge of the desk and stared at the clock again. He needed to breathe, needed to step away from the endless emails and tasks, from the humming fluorescents and the suffocating air of the claustrophobia inducing workroom. His body moved on autopilot as he made his way toward the nearby restroom, every step feeling like he was trudging through an ocean of molasses.

The bathroom was empty, sterile, and oppressively silent. Bright white tiles glared harshly beneath the fluorescent lights. He stumbled into the farthest stall, locking the door with trembling hands before collapsing onto the cold floor, knees drawn tightly to his chest. His heart was racing uncontrollably now, as if every unresolved thought, every buried feeling he'd shoved down into the depths of himself, was clawing desperately to escape. The bottled feelings of nearly 2 years of raw emotion threatening to explode from the inside out.

He broke not with a bang, but with a whimper.

Silent sobs shook his frame, tears sliding down his face and splattering onto his black jeans, yet he could no longer feel the wetness of the tears. He tried to keep quiet, but it felt like every emotion he'd ever suppressed was fighting its way to the surface, his skin feeling as if thousands of needles were being punched simultaneously across every single one of his pore. The weight of the isolation, the relentless expectations placed upon him, and the indescribable emptiness was finally laid bare.

"I’m tired," he whispered to no one, his voice trembling, barely audible even in the silence.

"I know," came a gentle voice from beside him.

He lifted his head sharply, startled. Leaning against the wall of stall was the girl. Her presence felt natural now, inevitable almost. She was beyond beautiful, flowing black hair cascading down her shoulders, almond-shaped eyes as dark as midnight, pale skin smooth like porcelain. She was dressed head to toe in the exact same outfit as the boy, mirroring his black jeans and white sweatshirt.

"You're beautiful" he choked out, his vision blurred yet fixed unwaveringly on her face. It felt so strange, acknowledging such beauty in a bathroom stall of the Allen building of all places.

"I know," she replied softly, her voice warm and sad, full of a quiet understanding that seemed impossible for anyone else to reach. 

The boy breathed heavily, trying to compose himself, but failing. He felt himself mentally unravel, crushed by the weight of years of suppressed emotion. 

"Are you ready?" she asked, gently. She reached out her right hand, revealing a handful of small pink pills cupped in the center of her palm.

He hesitated only a moment, then reached into his own pocket, mirroring her gesture. He held his own handful of pills, the pink dye smearing against his damp, trembling palm. He looked up at her, eyes fearful like caged prey.

"This won't hurt will it?"

She smiled sadly. "Silly," she said, softly chiding him with gentle warmth. "You've always had a healthy fear of pain, haven't you?"

"Answer the question."

"No," she reassured him tenderly. "If our research is correct, it'll feel just like falling asleep."

The boy stared down at his hand, contemplating the tiny pink pills nestled there. This was it—a quiet exit. It seemed peaceful enough. He slowly raised his hand to his mouth, feeling for once in a long time, in control of himself, in control of his actions. He brought his hand to his mouth in one smooth motion, swallowing the pills. he barely noticed their bitter aftertaste. She did the same, her movements graceful and calm, matching his resolve.

"Any last words?" she asked gently, the question so tender it barely broke the fragile quiet between them. "It might take a while."

He stared into her dark eyes one last time, finding in them a strange comfort that had eluded him elsewhere in life. Time seemed to stretch on, the passings of seconds feeling like the crossings of epochs. The two stared at one another, without a single word being exchanged, merely existing as entire eras dawned and waned.

"You've always been by my side, haven't you?" he finally asked, voice barely a whisper.

"Yes," she said simply, softly.

He nodded slowly. Since the first time he had tied the noose in 2021 she had been there, a not-so-silent companion that existed beyond the numbness, the apathy, and the exhaustion that had consumed him. Like everyone else, he had pushed her away time and time again, but she had always stuck by him, back when he was alone and especially now. Deep inside he was grateful for that. 

He closed his eyes.

"Then let's go home," he said quietly.

"Together?" she asked, her voice sympathetic and hopeful.

He nodded again, without hesitation this time.

"Together."
